# PLuS Tables

This folder contains filled mock tables used to summarize baseline characteristics and model results from the PLuS study population, stratified by comorbidity burden.

## File: `Modified-MockTable_Table1to3_filled.xlsx`

- **Table1** – *Characteristics of the PLuS population*  
  Summarizes demographic and baseline clinical variables (e.g., age, sex) for the study population, with means/proportions, 95% confidence intervals, and percentiles for continuous variables.

- **Table2** – *Stage distribution by comorbidity levels*  
  Displays the distribution of clinical cancer stage (e.g., IA, IB, II A) by the number of comorbid conditions (0, 1, or 2+), with associated p-values from chi-square tests.

- **Table3** – *Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality*  
  Presents hazard ratios (HRs) from Cox proportional hazards models for all-cause mortality, stratified by comorbidity level. Includes multiple HR estimates for different adjustment sets.

## File: `MockTable_PLuS_Tabls4to6_filled.xlsx`

- **Table 4** – *Hazard ratios of lung cancer diagnosis*  
  Shows HRs from Fine & Gray competing risk models for lung cancer incidence, stratified by number of comorbidities.

- **Table 5** – *Histology distribution by comorbidity level*  
  Tabulates the frequencies of lung cancer histology types (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous, small cell) across comorbidity groups, with chi-square p-values.

- **Table 6** – *Histology and stage distribution by comorbidity level*  
  Combines histologic subtype and clinical stage (localized, regional) by comorbidity level, detailing counts per group.
