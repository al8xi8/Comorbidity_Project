Description: In both the absence and presence of screening, the R package calculates 
   individual risks of lung cancer and lung cancer death based on covariates: age, 
   education, sex, race, smoking intensity/duration/quit-years, Body Mass Index, 
   family history of lung-cancer, and self-reported emphysema.  In the presence of 
   CT screening akin to the NLST (3 yearly screens, 5 years of follow-up), it uses 
   the covariates to estimate risk of false-positive CT screen as well as the 
   reduction in risk of lung cancer death and increase in risk of lung cancer screening.
   This package also estimates the Life Years Gained From Screening-CT (LYFS-CT) 
   as per Cheung et al., 2019. It requires the same variables as LCDRAT plus
   12 additional comorbidities and the year of patient assessment.
