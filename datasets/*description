# Datasets Folder

This folder contains input data for the LCrisks microsimulation model.

## Compressed Files

"expanded_data.csv.zip"
-Compressed version of the weight-expanded synthetic population input dataset. Unzip before use.

"nhis_lcrisks.csv.zip" 
-Compressed raw NHIS dataset (2010â€“2023) containing unprocessed variables from IPUMS NHIS. Unzip before preprocessing or recoding.

"Split NHIS Files (`nhis_000.csv` to `nhis_191.csv`)" 
-These 192 files are partitioned subsets of the full `expanded_data.csv` dataset, which represents the weight-expanded, imputed NHIS population cohort.  
-Each file contains a portion of the full dataset to enable **parallel processing**, **reduced memory usage**, and **scalable simulation workflows**.  
-All files follow the same structure and column order defined in `column_order_reference.csv`, ensuring compatibility with the LCrisks model.

> ğŸ“Œ To use: unzip files manually or with `unzip` / `gunzip` in your terminal.
