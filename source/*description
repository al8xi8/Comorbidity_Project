"LCSpecMortality.R"
-Defines lung cancer–specific mortality functions by histology and stage, using survival curves derived from U.S. population data.

"histology.R"
-Assigns histologic subtype (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous, small cell) based on risk profiles and random sampling. Essential for stratifying downstream mortality and treatment outcomes.

"followup_new.R"
-Simulates clinical follow-up outcomes after lung cancer detection, including stage progression, diagnosis timing, and transition probabilities for detected vs. undetected cases.

"treatment.R"
-Models treatment-related survival effects based on histology and stage. Incorporates differences in mortality by treatment receipt, including surgery and systemic therapy.

"lifetable_LCRAT.R"
-Provides modified life table calculations tailored to the LCrisks model. Estimates all-cause mortality probabilities using demographic and comorbidity-adjusted life tables.

"screening_core.R"
-Implements the core logic of the lung cancer screening intervention, including eligibility, screening frequency, detection rates, and outcome adjustments based on screening arm.

"screening_newages.R"
-Variant of the screening core logic that supports age-specific policy simulations or alternate screening guidelines. Allows flexible testing of non-standard age ranges.

"stage_pst.R"
-Predicts clinical stage at lung cancer diagnosis for both screened and unscreened individuals, accounting for lead-time bias and differential stage shift under screening.

"global_lungrads.R"
-Contains global variables, control flags, and parameter settings shared across all LCrisks functions — including lung-RADS thresholds, simulation settings, and risk model assumptions.
